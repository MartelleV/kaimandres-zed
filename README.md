## Philosophy

> Kaimandres is handcrafted for the "deep void," balancing the renowned sleek aesthetics of **Poimandres** with the robust semantic logic and dimming capabilities of **Kanagawa**.

While the original Poimandres offers a sleek minimal aesthetic, Kaimandres introduces a specific tuning of shades to ensure syntax elements pop without causing eye strain, maintaining a balance between **readability** and **aesthetics**.

---

## Features

- **Semantic Depth:** Full utilization of Zed's syntax highlighting features to distinguish variables, keywords, and control flow logic clearly.
- **Enhanced Palette:** Cherry-picked shades that introduce new colors while strictly maintaining the original "soul" of the Poimandres palette.
- **Deep Immersion:** The UI uses `inkBlack` and `voidBlack` tones to blend the editor canvas seamlessly with the sidebars and panels.
- **Focus-Driven:** Italics are used sparingly for keywords and comments to create flow, while bolding is reserved for control flow.
